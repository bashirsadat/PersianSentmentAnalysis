# PersianSentmentAnalysis
This project presents how to use latent semantic analysis to find the
relations between terms and documents of Persian text. I used
both Scala and Python for doing this task. The base of the work in
this paper is chapter six of the Advanced Analytics with Spark
book. I used the latent semantic analysis to find relations
between documents and terms. LSA is an unsupervised learning
technique that extracts the essential meaning or most important
aspects of a corpus. I used a Dataset of Persian text from
Hamshahri Newspaper. However, the NLP parts of the chapter did
not work on the Persian text. Therefore, I used python to preprocess
the texts before running the LSA model on it. I explore
the complications that the Persian text processing pipeline might
have and propose solutions for each of the problems faced.
